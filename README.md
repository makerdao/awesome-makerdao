# Awesome MakerDAO

Awesome-MakerDAO \(AMD\) is a community-driven project, designed to be a resource people can use to familiarize themselves with Dai and MakerDAO. All are welcome to contribute.

**Get Started**

Those interested in MakerDAO are invited to explore AMD's collection of resources below. Get to know Maker with the help of beginner guides, official documentation, analysis pieces, tools, partnership announcements, AMAs, podcasts, and third-party apps, and more.

**Please Be Advised**

Users are _**strongly encouraged**_ to perform their own due diligence before trusting third-party services listed below. Despite MakerDAO's best efforts to provide a clean resource, given the nature of the cryptocurrency realm, scams do exist, and even great projects are frequently compromised.

The Maker Foundation grants program offers bounties to community members who bring attention to compromised third-party apps and services.
